# timlapse.sh
very basic timelapse recording script

# How to use
Start a recording with   
`timlapse.sh restart`  
When run without argument timlapse.sh will continue the last recording session.  
To compile/combine to be a video, run compile.sh, it will produce a `video.mp4` file.  
To change parameter, just edit the script :).

# Requirement
scrot and ffmpeg
